		<text class="text">Struggling to think of a good idea for a dinner party theme? Not sure how to dec up? Take a browse through our fantastic ideas below or head straight to our <a href="#american">American</a> section, or our <a href="#army">Army</a> section to be inspired!</text>

<br>
	<h2 id="american"><i class="em em-us"></i>American!<i class="em em-us"></i></h2>
	<br>
	<text>
		This classic theme is always a favourite with dinner guests, and there are loads of fantastic decorations to make your evening as authentic as a night in the Hard Rock Cafe!
	<br>
		<image src="american_flag.jpg" width="20%" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="10">
	<br>
		First things first, let your guests know it's fully American with some cute mini USA flags! These can be put everywhere from on top of burgers, to sticking them around the room.
	<br>
		Find these for less than &pound3 on Amazon here: <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/American-Stars-Stripes-Flag-Picks/dp/B01KGXBQXU/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1480186592&sr=8-1&keywords=mini+flag+USA" target="_new"> American Flags!</a> 
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
		<image src="red_cups.jpg" width="20%" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10">
		<text>Red plastic cups are quintessentially American! They are typically called "Solo cups" stateside, after the most popular brand. There's actually a reason for this: tv shows and movies avoid showing teens consuming alcohol, and even for adult parties, filmmakers may not want to show specific brands. Boom. Plastic cups, there could be anything in there! It doesn't even have to be alcohol! (But it's alcohol.)
	<br>
		Find these for less that &pound6 on Amazon here: <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Ruby-Apple-American-Party-Cups/dp/B00LI2MGZ6/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1480193658&sr=8-1&keywords=red+cups" target="_new"> Red Cups!</a>
	<br>
	<br>
		And you can't have an American party without drinking games! They have them everywhere, but some of them are as American as Uncle Sam eating a rocket pop on the Fourth of July. And most of these involve red cups. One partcular favourite is Beer Pong, featured in pretty much every American college movie ever. And if you get super good, maybe you could even try some of these super cool trick shots:

	<br>
		And finally, the food. American food is super easy to make, and not too expensive either. Some of our personal favourites are:
		<ul class="food">
			<li>Hot dogs</li><br>
			<li>Fries</li></i><br>
			<li>Rocket Pops</li><br>
			<li>Mac & Cheese</li><br>
			<li>Popcorn</li><br>
			<li>Waffles</li><br>
		</ul>
		But our all time favourite is definitely party burgers! Find our incredible recipe here: <a href="">Classic Burger</a>

		Having an army theme is slightly different from the usual themes and will really give your guests a night they won't forget! We've got loads of ideas from bunting to drinks, so read on to find out more!
	<br>
		<image src="bunting.jpg" width="15%" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="10">
	<br>
		Start by setting the scene with this awesome army bunting, hang it all over the walls, outside your house so everyone knows where they're going, and around the table. It's so versatile! Paired with army cups, and netting, your guests will think they've been transported into army barracks!
	<br>

		Once you've dressed your house, it's time to dress yourself. Army costumes are easy to put together, with a massive range of ideas. The most inexpensive costume requires you to buy almost nothing at all. All you need is a white, green or grey T-shirt and matching joggers. Find permanent markers, fabric paints or acrylic paint in brown, black and several shades of green. Draw large, abstract shapes all over the shirt and trousers in black marker. Fill in the shapes with the paint or markers, making sure that no two shapes of the same colour touch each other.
	<br>
		And to add to the look, find some effective camouflage make up here: <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/CAMOUFLAGE-MILITARY-PAINT-STICK-CREAM/dp/B002UOSXEY" target="_new">Camouflage Make Up</a>
	<br>
		And finally,the biggest part of the dinner party, the food and drink! We have loads of clever snack ideas to help transform any standard meal into that fit for a soldier! Take a look:
		<ul>
			<li>Miniature Bombs (meatballs, falafel ball etc)</li><br>
			<li>Band-aid Patches (ravioli with red sauce)</li><br>
			<li>BB-Q Chicken</li><br>
			<li>A camouflage coloured iced cake</li><br>
		</ul>
